I added : 'using namespace enumerations' to each source files. - I am not sure why question asks 'explain briefly why you didn't have to add that statement to the source files that contain the definitions for the Weekday and Pressure enumerated types.',
because I did add the statement to source files.

6. 
I added : 
using namespace enumerations::operator++;
using namespace enumerations::operator--;
using namespace enumerations::operator<<;

The question does not clarify what to answer so I just added code I wrote.
